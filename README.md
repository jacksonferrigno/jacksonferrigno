## ‚ú® Projects

A selection of projects showcasing my technical skills and interests:

### [Bio Innovation Engine Server (MCP Server)](https://github.com/jacksonferrigno/bio-mcp)

A Model-Context Protocol (MCP) server facilitating bio-inspired innovation research. Key tools include web research (Google Custom Search API), analysis of biological concepts (YAKE), storage (PostgreSQL), and report generation.

### [Electricity Demand Predictor (Research Project)](https://github.com/jacksonferrigno/Electricity-Demand-Predictor)

Applied deep learning (bidirectional LSTM via TensorFlow/Keras) for energy demand prediction ($R^2 = 0.911$) and reinforcement learning (PPO in custom Gymnasium env) for grid optimization, reducing blackout risk by 35%. Presented Spring 2025.

### [Stock Misinformation RAG Model](https://github.com/jacksonferrigno/Stock-Misinformation-RAG-Model)

Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system combining stock data and headlines to provide context-aware investment summaries.

### [BTC Trader](https://github.com/jacksonferrigno/crypto_trader)

Built an LSTM-based model (Keras) for Bitcoin price prediction and implemented a Dockerized auto-trading system executing trades based on real-time signals.

### [Argos ‚Äì HDL Code Analyzer](https://github.com/jacksonferrigno/HDL-Code-Analyzer)

Created a Python NLP model using CodeBERT for Hardware Description Language (HDL) pattern detection, achieving 85% accuracy for FSM, counter, and ALU structures.

### Attorney Alert Full Stack Application

Co-founded and led technical development of legal tech company. Engineered scalable AWS backend (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB) to automate processing of 30K+ inmate records/month. Developed a TypeScript/Tailwind frontend.

### [Dxter ‚Äì Blood Analysis NLP App](https://github.com/jacksonferrigno/Dxter)

Developed an NLP application (`node-nlp`) for interpreting blood lab results (~85% accuracy) with a TypeScript/Tailwind frontend and integrated knowledge base.
